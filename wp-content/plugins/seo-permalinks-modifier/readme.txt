Use SEO Permalinks Modifier to remove common words like 'a', 'the', 'to', 'what' from post permalink to improve SEO.

== Description ==

The SEO Permalinks Modifier plugin help to remove common words like 'a', 'the', 'to', 'what' from post slugs to improve search engine optimization performance for your wordpress site.

For example, when you publish a post with a title like this: 

"How to Improve SEO Rank",

Wordpress automatically assigns a long filename to your post, called a post permalink:

/how-to-improve-seo-rank

SEO Slugs plugin strips common words like "how", "to" out of your post permalink to make it more search engine friendly. With SEO Permalinks Modifier plugin activated, the permalink for our example blog post would look like this:

/improve-seo-rank

The permalink is generated on saving a post (so you get a chance to look at it before publishing, and change it), or on publish. It won't overwrite an existing permalink. You can force a new permalink generation by deleting the existing one.
